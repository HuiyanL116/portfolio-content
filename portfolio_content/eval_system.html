			The old version of the annual evaluation system had a lot of design and 
            accessibility issues. Therefore product managers of the department initiated a 
            project to redesign the evaluation system. As a critical part of corporate 
            management, annual evaluations serve multiple purposes such as proposing 
            promotion decisions and determining payroll. A good evaluation system empowers 
            fluid transactions between corperate levels and promotes process efficiency. 

            I assisted in the redesign of this project, along with the design lead of Agoraâ€™s 
            backend R&D department. The project goal and stakeholders were ambiguous at the 
            beginning, so we as designers had more opportunities to work with the product 
            managers in determining the scope of the design. It was a new experience for me 
            to be able to attend discussions and meetings with various stakeholders. I was 
            able to think of and analyze a product from a more macroscopic view.
