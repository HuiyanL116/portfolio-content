			The data analytics product for AgoraChat is a data monitor and analysis product 
            used to assist our client in tracking software performance, user usage, and user 
            behavior. It visualizes events’/behavioral terminal and end-to-end data. We 
            utilized different graphs and expressions for various data visualization. For 
            example, choropleth maps for demonstrating worldwide/mainland China request/usage 
            distribution, and line charts for demonstrating request/usage trends.

            I worked on this project under the supervision of the design lead of Agora’s backend 
            R&D department. The most challenging part of this project is organizing content 
            and sorting data into accessible card modules. 

            This project was eventually developed and incorporated into the Agora analytics product.
