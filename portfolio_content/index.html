			I was honored to work with Agora.io from February 2022 to August 2022. Agora.io is a PaaS company 
            that designs real-time engagement APIs. I was recruited as a product designer for the data product 
            development team and the corporate management team. During my stay, I worked on several projects 
            including R&D project management tool design, Agora product data analytics tool design, and corporate 
            annual evaluation system redesign. 

            The projects I worked on mainly lie within the scope of 2B tools. Hence, each of them includes a vast 
            amount of logic organization and data presentation. It was definitely both challenging and inspiring. 
            I learned from each project and rapidly grew as a UI/UX designer.
