			The R&D project and human resource management tool serve to solve human resource 
            distribution conflicts and project schedule conflicts. 
            
            The backend R&D team has limited front-end developers and software test engineers, 
            and aside from backend R&D’s own projects, developers and engineers often need to 
            prioritize project support demands from other departments. Often we see project 
            delivery dates postpone due to conflicting human resources allocation. Employees 
            complain that they often receive work requests while having excessive projects on 
            hand, however, it is difficult to communicate their schedules to every sector of 
            Agora’s R&D team. Hence, we initialized this project to mitigate the situation.

            I was the main UI/UX designer of this project. The product mainly adopted the format 
            of a combined interactable table and Gantt chart. The table allows human resource 
            allocation, while the Gantt chart is mainly used for scheduling. Under the project 
            view, we can see one specific project’s cycle clearly; under the team view, we can 
            see each team member’s total workload distribution with multiple projects. 

            This project was eventually developed and is now in use at Agora.io.
